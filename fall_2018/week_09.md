## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, as planned, I implemented unit healthbars and a level select menu. For unit healthbars, a colored bar is centered about the head of all player and enemy units, displaying the unit's current health as a percentage of its total health. The level select menu is a bit more complex, consisting of a separate scene that is loaded at startup, and transitions to the level load scene upon interaction with the start button. The level select screen is visually barebones, but is functional, and can be beautified during future work.

## This Week's Plan
This week I will be on Thanksgiving break, so I don't expect to make a great deal of progress. I will most likely spend some time prototyping unit classes with unique attributes, to be implemented as part of next week's goals.

## Anything Blocking?
No blocking factors this week.
