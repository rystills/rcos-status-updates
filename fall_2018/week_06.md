## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I implemented two things. First, I added the ability to freeze/unfreeze time by pressing space. This allows the player to plan out unit movement and actions before they happen, keeping with the tactical theme of the game. Second, I implemented a level storage/loading system in JSON. This will allow us to develop levels in an editor of our choice, make our level files easier to diff when collaborating, and open our game up to future modding support.  

## This Week's Plan
Next week, I intend to continue on with the level loading code. While the basic system is in place, there is definitely room for growth and cleanup. In addition, I intend to start creating some demo graphics so that we have nice visuals to show off when it comes time for our large group presentation.

## Anything Blocking?
No blocking factors this week.
