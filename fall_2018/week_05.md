## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I implemented the core Unit code. I developed a system which allows Units to walk on paths at a framerate independent speed, and to update their rotation at the same time to match their facing direction. Additionally, I finally fixed a persistent bug with GitHub incorrectly syncing Unity metadata files.

## This Week's Plan
This week I intend to work on time freezing and unit collisions. Time freezing will allow the user to plan our their units' actions before they happen, which is a core component of games in the style our team is looking to achieve. Unit collisions will ensure that units pass by each other rather than through each other.

## Anything Blocking?
No blocking factors this week.
