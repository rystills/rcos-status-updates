## Last Week's Accomplishments
last week we had our large group presentation, so I spent considerable time getting the demo up to speed. I implemented and laid out more graphics assets, fixed a minor bug with the vision cone rotation offset, and implemented unit interactions in the form of firing lasers when in range and in vision.

## This Week's Plan
This week, I intend to implement unit healthbars, as well as a basic level select menu. This will push us closer to a fully playable prototype for others to try.

## Anything Blocking?
No blocking factors this week.
