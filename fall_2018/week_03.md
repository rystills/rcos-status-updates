## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I was primarily focused on the project and development structure. I spent some time syncing up each of the individual members' work so far, and ensured that simultaneous development will play nice with GitHub in the Unity engine. I also setup a basic scene for playtesting and development.

## This Week's Plan
This week I intend to implement unit path drawing via the mouse. The idea is that when the user clicks and drags the mouse starting from a unit, a path will extend out from that unit's position, indicating the direction in which they should move and orient themselves. This will serve as the foundation for player-unit interaction.

## Anything Blocking?
No blocking factors this week.
