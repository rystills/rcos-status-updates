## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I did a couple of things. First, I managed to get a dynamically generated realtime vision cone mesh working. This means units' vision is now displayed via a polygonal mesh, which uses realtime collision detection to determine its' bounds. Additionally, I fleshed out the level loading process, with cleaner and more extensible logic. Finally, I implemented some demo graphics, keeping our upcoming presentation in mind.

## This Week's Plan
In order to prepare for our presentation, I intend to focus my efforts this week on the visual side, implementing more demo suitable graphics assets. I also intend to implement basic enemy -> player unit interactions, in order to ensure that we have meaningful gameplay to show off beyond merely discussing the technical details. Finally, I intend to squash any known bugs to ensure that the demo runs as smoothly as possible.

## Anything Blocking?
No blocking factors this week.
