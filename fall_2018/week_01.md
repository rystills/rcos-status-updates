## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, as our first official development week, our team created a revised project proposal. This new proposal outlines the shift in our focus from a racing game to a tactical top down game, as well as our shift from the Unreal Engine to the Unity engine. We spent the remainder of the week making sure everyone in the team was sufficiently familiar navigating the Unity game engine.

## This Week's Plan
This week I intend to setup the framework for our game. This means my time will be spent on setting up the basic game settings that we'll rely on for the remainder of our development time, as well as potentially working on some very basic functionality.

## Anything Blocking?
The only blocking factor this week is ensuring that sufficient engine familiarity has been met by all team members
