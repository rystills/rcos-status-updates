## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I went home for Thanksgiving break. As such, I took most of the week off, doing some light debugging and thinking about how best to implement a basic unit class system. 

## This Week's Plan
This week I intend to move forward with Unit classes. Each class will have a unique look and set of attributes. I would also like to try some approaches to make the UI more visually appealing (particilarly the main menu), as at the moment it is rather barebones. 

## Anything Blocking?
No blocking factors this week.
