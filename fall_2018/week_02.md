## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I started creating the game skeleton. This involved a number of miscellaneous steps, including setting up the camera, defining an effective coordinate system / scale, and playing with some basic prototype objects. 

## This Week's Plan
This week I'd like to regroup with the rest of the team. I think it's important to take some time to organize each of our individual objectives, and then begin working towards a basic playable scene.

## Anything Blocking?
No blocking factors this week.
