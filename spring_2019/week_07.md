## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This week I finished basic LLVM code generation. By working backwards from the 
Kaleidoscope tutorial, I was able to adapt the general strategy to our AST model.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I intend to refactor and remove superfluous components from my code generation
functions, then sync up with my team and start assisting with more complex language extensions.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I am not obstructed by any blocking factors at this time.
