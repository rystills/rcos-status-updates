## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week was dedicated to feature discussion and research. I met with the team to have a discussion about \
> some of our proposed syntax, and to come up with a plan of action for working towards our first functional release. \
> I also familiarized myself with the basic Parsing/Lexing Haskell framework being implemented by Jordan.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week, I plan to begin writing the main C++ file for reading the AST generated by the Haskell team. I also plan \
> to look into converting our AST (which should initially be something resembling simple lambda calculus) to LLVM code.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I am not obstructed by any blocking factors at this time.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
