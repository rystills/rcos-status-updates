## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This week, I introducted a proper code of conduct and contribution guides to StillGood.
> These things, while easily overlooked, are a key part of ensuring that StillGood remains
> an inclusive and productive collaborative project in the future. I also cleaned up our 
> readme a bit, and added our license and code of conduct to our readme.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> As this was the final week, I do not have any immediate plans. Over the long term, I would 
> like to continue to add more functionality to StillGood, in order to make it into a more 
> practical programming language for development.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I am not obstructed by any blocking factors at this time.

## Notes
