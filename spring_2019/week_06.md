## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I finished naive code generation through LLVM. The code that is generated
> presently makes a number of assumptions, but will serve as a good basis for more 
> proper code generation moving forward.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I intend to remove the assumptions from my present code generation methods,
> in order to achieve proper basic code generation support.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I am not obstructed by any blocking factors at this time.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
