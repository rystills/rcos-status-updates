## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I started work on the main C++ file for working with the Haskell generated AST.
> First, I added the ability to run the Haskell parsing code directly from C++ and capture the 
> output, storing the resulting AST in a string. Second, I included and implemented the code corresponding 
> to a JSON parsing library, and demonstrated that it was successfully able to parse the AST as JSON.
> I also documented the current requirements/install instructions and usage guide in the readme.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I intend to make progress in converting the AST into LLVM code. This will involve 
> communication with the parsing team, as well as some research into linking against the various 
> LLVM library files.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I am not obstructed by any blocking factors at this time.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
