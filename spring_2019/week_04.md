> LLVM tutorial to match our language syntax has proved challenging, but should be completed soon.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I intend to have LLVM code generation fully functional in Python. This is a continuation
> of my efforts since last week.
