## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I begain seriously working on LLVM code generation in Python. Adapting the 
> Kaleidoscope LLVM tutorial to match our language syntax has proved challenging due to the  
> structural differences between our AST (which is produced from a lambda calculus-lile syntax)
> and the Kaleidoscope AST (which more closely resembles imperative logic).

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I intend to continue working towards naive code generation through LLVM, in order to build a
> foundation for full code generation in the coming weeks.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I am not obstructed by any blocking factors at this time.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
