## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I spent a lot of time working with and documenting the install process for LLVM 
> on Windows. Ultimately, I decided to switch the LLVM code generation from C++ to Python, as the 
> LLVM-Lite Python package is much easier to install and work with. Regardless of which language is
> used, however, LLVM must be installed properly before any code can be generated, so it is crucial
> for me to take my time and document the steps I have taken to help contributors who come after me.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I intend to get some successful LLVM code generation up and running in Python. My intention 
> is for this to properly utilize the LLVM library helper functions rather than writing everything from scratch.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I am not obstructed by any blocking factors at this time.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
